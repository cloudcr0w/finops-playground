# FinOps Playground (POC) 💰☁️

This repository is a **proof-of-concept** project exploring how to apply **FinOps practices** to cloud cost management in AWS.

## 📂 Project structure
- `budget.tf` → Terraform AWS Budgets definition (monthly budget + alert)
- `cost-sample.json` → Mock billing data
- `cost_report.py` → Python script generating simple cost reports
- `README.md` → Documentation & next steps

## 🚀 Features
- Define AWS Budgets with Terraform
- Analyze billing data (mock) with Python
- Simple cost reporting per service + total cost

## 📈 Next steps
- Connect to **AWS Cost Explorer API** for real billing data
- Export reports to **CSV / PowerBI**
- Automate reports with **AWS Lambda**

## 🎯 Why this project?
I’m transitioning into **Cloud & DevOps** and exploring **FinOps** as a natural extension of my background in **SAP process optimization** and **AWS cloud projects**.  
This is my first step in combining **cost awareness** with cloud engineering skills.
